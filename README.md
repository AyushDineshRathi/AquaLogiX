## Key Features

* **Natural Language Queries**: Ask complex questions in plain English and get immediate, accurate answers.
* **Intelligent Text-to-SQL**: Powered by a local LLM (Ollama) and guided by robust prompt engineering to translate questions into precise SQL queries.
* **Dynamic Visualizations**: Automatically generates the best visualization for your data, including interactive tables, line charts, bar charts, and geospatial maps.
* **Conversational Memory**: Remembers the context of your current chat session, allowing for natural follow-up questions.
* **Automated Data Pipeline**: A resilient ETL script that processes raw ARGO NetCDF (`.nc`) files, standardizes data, and loads it into a structured PostgreSQL database.

## System Architecture

The system is built on a modern, decoupled architecture featuring a Python backend, a Streamlit frontend, and a local AI core. This ensures scalability and maintainability.
