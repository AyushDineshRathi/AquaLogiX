ðŸŒŠ AquaLogix: Conversational Ocean Data Analyst
AquaLogix is an AI-powered platform designed for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) that revolutionizes how we interact with complex oceanographic data. It provides a conversational interface to query, analyze, and visualize vast datasets from ARGO floats, making ocean data accessible to researchers, policymakers, and students without requiring any technical expertise.

## Key Features
Natural Language Queries: Ask questions in plain English (e.g., "Show me salinity profiles near the equator") and get immediate, accurate answers.

Intelligent Text-to-SQL: Powered by a local LLM using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to translate user questions into precise SQL queries.

Automated Data Pipeline: An end-to-end ETL script that processes raw ARGO NetCDF (.nc) files and loads them into a structured PostgreSQL database.

Interactive Visualizations: A user-friendly dashboard (built with Streamlit) to display data as geospatial maps, time-series plots, and tables.

Extensible Architecture: Designed to be easily extended with new data sources like BGC floats, gliders, and satellite data in the future.

## System Architecture
The system is built on a modern, decoupled architecture that ensures scalability and maintainability.

## Technology Stack
Backend: Python, FastAPI

Frontend: Streamlit

Database: PostgreSQL (for structured data), FAISS (for vector store)

AI/ML: LangChain, Ollama (with llama3:8b), Sentence-Transformers

Data Handling: xarray, pandas, SQLAlchemy
